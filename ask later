Yes — **100% correct**: if your goal is a high-quality LLM experience (RAG, character tone, reasoning, internal logic, POV tracking), then:

> ✅ **Chunk by scene**,
> ❌ Not by chapter
> ❌ Not by token count

## 🧠 Why Scene-Based Chunking is Superior

* Scenes are **semantically coherent**: they have consistent tone, speaker, POV, action.
* GPT can reason better over *a single scene* than an arbitrary 500-token slice.
* You avoid “cut-off mid-dialogue” issues that mess with both summarization and retrieval.

So the question becomes:

> **How do you detect where a scene starts and ends — especially if it's not cleanly chapter-bound?**

Let’s break it down:

## 🔍 Step-by-Step: How to Detect Scene Boundaries

### ⚙️ 1. **Use Heuristics First (for automation)**

You can get surprisingly far by auto-chunking based on these clues:

| Signal                                    | What it means                                                     |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🧵 Paragraph gap > 1 line                 | Potential scene change                                            |
| 🗣️ Sudden shift in speaker focus         | e.g. “Meanwhile, Arnold…”                                         |
| ⏱️ Time skip phrases                      | "Later that day", "After resting for a while", "The next morning" |
| 📍 Location change                        | “In the city”, “Back at the camp”, “Inside the dungeon”           |
| 💭 Tone/POV shift                         | From dialogue to introspection, or from Jake to Arnold            |
| 📦 Tutorial boxes or level-up text blocks | Often signal transitions                                          |
| 💥 Fights starting/ending                 | Often have a distinct arc, worth isolating                        |

You can detect these via:

* regex on key phrases
* line spacing
* “speaker swap” detection (e.g. `“Jake said”` → `“Arnold muttered”`)

#### 💡 Pro tip: Combine multiple weak signals into one stronger rule.

### 🤖 2. **Use GPT to label boundaries (semi-automated pass)**

Once you have a first-pass chunking, you can feed it into a prompt like:

```markdown
### INSTRUCTIONS:
Mark the text where a new *scene* begins. A scene is a coherent unit of time, place, and character focus. Use `=== SCENE START ===` and `=== SCENE END ===` to mark the boundaries.

Keep scenes relatively short and cohesive (2–10 paragraphs). If a scene continues across a major topic change, treat it as a new scene.

### INPUT:
Chapter 1165

[chapter text goes here]

### OUTPUT:
=== SCENE START ===
[scene text]
=== SCENE END ===
...
```

Or ask for:

* Summary of each scene
* POV tag
* Characters present
* Fight vs. dialogue vs. travel

You can use this output to generate your scene-level `.json` index automatically.

### 🧭 3. **How to Handle Multi-Chapter Scenes**

Two options:

#### Option A: **Scene IDs include spanning logic**

```json
{
	"scene_id": "1168-1_to_1169-2",
	"starts_in": 1168,
	"ends_in": 1169,
	"start_line": 45,
	"end_line": 13
}
```

#### Option B: **Keep scene chunks in separate files, even if it spans chapters**

E.g. your file structure:

```
scene_chunks/
	1165-1.json
	1165-2.json
	1166-1.json
	1166-2_part1.json
	1166-2_part2.json
```

And each scene has:

```json
{
	"chapter_span": [1166, 1167],
	"start_line": 122,
	"end_line": 24,
	...
}
```

That way, even if the text spans chapters, the **scene stays logically grouped**.

---

### 🧼 4. **Final cleanup: Manual review or GPT reflow**

After first-pass chunking:

* Manually spot-check a few key arcs (first big fight, city arrival, Jake vs Sovereign)
* Use GPT to refine chunk length or rebalance splits
* Rechunk outliers if needed (e.g. massive scenes or scenes split incorrectly)

---

## 💡 Best Practice: Use Scene Files as Your Unit of Truth

Once chunked:

* Embed each scene as a vector unit
* Store metadata like `scene_id`, `characters`, `summary`, `pov`, etc.
* Reference the original chapter+post ID for traceability

That way your RAG system stays tight, grounded, and accurate.

## 🧰 Want Help?

I can build you a:

* `scene_chunker.py` script that chunks `.md` files into scenes via regex + heuristics
* Optional GPT-4-based post-processor to label POV, tone, character presence
* JSON schema + export tool to save each scene as `.json` or `.md`

Just say the word.

📄 Option 3: Auto-doc

You can even use the schema to auto-generate docs or Markdown files showing:


## Skill Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `rarity` | string | Skill rarity — one of Inferior, Common, Rare, etc |
| `type` | string | Functional type — e.g. "Combat Passive" |
| `effects` | object | What the skill actually does |
...
