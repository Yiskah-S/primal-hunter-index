# DRAFT ACTIVE DISCUSSION IN PROGRESS

## IDEAS

🧠 The inference object
"inference": {
  "allow_inferred": false,
  "confidence": 0.98,
  "source_priority": "direct_quote",
  "importance": 0.9,
  "context_weight": 1.0
}

This is not covered in any current doc.
It’s a potential future extension for Codex QA or fine-tuning weighting.

Keep it, but mark it non-canon metadata.
Perfect home: docs/design/pipeline_flow.md (section: Inference Weighting and Certainty Propagation).

📍Action:

Add this block (verbatim) to that doc’s drafts section, labeled “optional Codex inference fields for meta.json”.
