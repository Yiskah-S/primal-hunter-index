## Applications Beyond This Project

This pattern can be reused to build:

- 🏡 Garden designers (plants.json + tone tags like "cottagecore" or "bold contrast")
- 🧪 Science hypothesis simulators (facts + inference types + tone = research narrative)
- 🎨 Color palette / moodboard generators (tags = emotion, season, saturation)
- 📚 Educational storybuilders (facts + age_tone + subject_tags → custom narratives)

It is not PH-specific — just proven out here first.

## TL;DR

This project demonstrates:

> 🔧 Structured generation from tagged, canonical facts  
> 🎭 With narrative control via tone and scene-function tags  
> 🚫 Plus hallucination mitigation through schema and provenance  
> 🧠 All in a reusable four-layer architecture
