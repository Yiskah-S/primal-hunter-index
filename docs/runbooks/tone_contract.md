# 📜 PH Tone Contract: How to Write Like *Primal Hunter*

This is your **golden reference** when writing any new scene, character, or arc meant to feel like it belongs in the
*Primal Hunter* universe — whether it’s from Jake’s POV, Arnold’s, or an original side protagonist.

When in doubt, check here first.

## ✅ Core Tone Principles

### 1. The System is **indifferent**, not a DM

- It doesn’t bend for drama, pity, or personalities.  
- When characters succeed, it’s because they planned, exploited, or risked.  
- It punishes stupidity, greed, and delay — but only if **rules were broken**.  

> **Write it like physics, not like God.**

---

### 2. Power is **earned**, not given

- Tier-ups, evolutions, and breakthroughs **require payment**:  
  - Injuries  
  - Time  
  - System attention  
  - Debt  
  - Loss  
- “A free upgrade” is **always foreshadowed** to have a cost later.

---

### 3. Canon is **quote-backed observation**

- The world isn’t a spreadsheet — it’s a foggy simulation glimpsed through POVs.  
- What a character *believes* may not be true.  
- If a rule is applied, cite where it was *seen*.  

---

### 4. Progression is **nonlinear but logical**

- Higher rarity ≠ stronger. Context, synergy, and timing matter more.  
- Affinity, gear, domain conditions, Path, and even narrative tone affect outcome.

### 5. Characters are **POV-consistent**

| Character | Core Traits | Writing Notes |
|------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Jake** | Adaptable, cunning, emotionally reactive, occasionally arrogant | Reacts fast, learns on the fly, weaponizes instinct |
| **Arnold** | Analytical, recursive, engineer-mindset, legacy-aware | Experiments methodically, logs observations, builds logic trees |

You can write anyone — as long as their decisions are grounded in internal logic, not plot convenience.

## 🧠 Litmus Tests Before Writing a Scene

| Check | Question |
|-------|-----------|
| 🧪 **Constraint Check** | What *can’t* the character do right now? What’s limiting them? |
| 📏 **Observation Check** | What did they see, sense, measure, or infer? |
| 💸 **Tradeoff Check** | What cost does this action carry, now or later? |
| 📜 **Provenance Check** | If you’re stating a fact, what quote or scene backs it? |
| 🔬 **State Change Check** | Does this scene add at least one new observable `event`? |

---

## ❌ Instant Red Flags

Don’t do this — it breaks tone and world logic:

- “Suddenly, he leveled up.” ← No cost, no setup  
- “She just *knew* it worked.” ← No sensory proof  
- “The System liked her idea.” ← Personification  
- “He was stronger than Jake now.” ← Untestable assertion  
- “She maxed a skill offscreen.” ← No quote, no timeline, no event  

---

## ✅ Perfectly On-Tone Example

> “He knew the next rank of Meditation required inner silence… but what counted as ‘silence’ to the System?  
> He hadn’t found the boundary yet. The last time, it accepted his calm.  
> This time, it didn’t.”

This feels like *Primal Hunter*: sharp, systemic, internally consistent, and **earned**.
