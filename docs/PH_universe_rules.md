# 📜 PH Tone Contract: How to Write Like Primal Hunter

This is your golden reference when writing any new scene, character, or arc meant to feel like it belongs in the *Primal Hunter* universe — whether it's from Jake’s POV or Arnold’s. When in doubt, check here.

## ✅ Core Tone Principles

### 1. The System is **indifferent**, not a DM
- It doesn’t bend for drama, pity, or personalities.
- When characters succeed, it’s because they planned, exploited, or risked.
- It punishes stupidity, greed, and delay — but only if **rules were broken**.

> **Write it like physics, not like God.**

---

### 2. Power is **earned**, not given
- Tier-ups, evolutions, and breakthroughs **require payment**:
  - Injuries
  - Time
  - System attention
  - Debt
  - Loss
- “A free upgrade” is **always foreshadowed** to have a cost later.

---

### 3. Canon is **quote-backed observation**
- The world isn’t a spreadsheet. It’s a foggy simulation you glimpse through character POVs.
- What a character *thinks* is true may not be.
- If a rule is applied, cite where it was seen.

---

### 4. Progression is **nonlinear but logical**
- Higher rarity ≠ stronger. Timing, synergy, and use matter more.
- Affinity, gear, domain conditions, Path, and even the narrator’s tone affect performance.

---

### 5. Characters are **POV-consistent**
- Jake is adaptable, cunning, emotionally reactive, and arrogant.
- Arnold is analytical, methodical, legacy-aware, and recursive.
- You can write anyone — as long as their decisions are grounded in their internal logic, not plot convenience.

## 🧠 Litmus Tests Before Writing a Scene

### 🧪 Constraint Check
> What *can’t* the character do right now? What’s limiting them?

### 📏 Observation Check
> What did they see, sense, measure, or infer?

### 💸 Tradeoff Check
> What cost does this action carry, either now or later?

### 📜 Provenance Check
> If we’re stating a fact, what quote or scene does it come from?

### 🔬 State Change Check
> Does this scene add at least one new observable or inferable `event`?

## ❌ Instant Red Flags (Don't Do This)

- “Suddenly, he leveled up.” ← Without cost or setup
- “She just *knew* it worked.” ← Without observable input
- “The System liked her idea.” ← Personification
- “He was stronger than Jake now.” ← Untestable assertion
- “She maxed a skill offscreen.” ← No quote, no timeline, no event

---

## ✅ Perfectly On-Tone

> “He knew the next rank of Meditation required inner silence… but what counted as ‘silence’ to the System? He hadn’t found the boundary yet. The last time, it accepted his calm. This time, it didn’t.”

This feels like PH. Keep it sharp. Keep it system-consistent. Keep it earned.
